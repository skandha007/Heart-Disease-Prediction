# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Random Forest Classification Algorithm is used to predict the Heart disease.


Preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for
predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that
more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine
Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate. The
project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing.The aim is
to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input
features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether
heart disease is present or not
